# CONTRIBUTING

## Why I should spend my time for the project?
__Invest__ time in opensource is a great opportunity to grow as professionist, enjoy in the spare time and give back something to the community. Every day we use for free something released in OS licensing, it's important to keep balance what we get with what we gitf to make community sustainable. Moreover, OS project, is a great opportunity to make experiments, meet people, compare with other and new technologies. So... why DO NOT spend time in OS projects?

## How can I help?
Help can be given in any form, basing on your time budget, skill and whishes. Main help on this project is on dev sid. Developing new modules, backend, frontend, make test, dev ops, or simply write some docs are the most wanted contribution.
But also activities not strictly related whit dev are also welcome. Write the product home page, help with marketing, posting into personal blog... How you can help is your choice.

## How to contribute
We focus on dev realated contrinution. All other proposal will be discussed by person (opening an issue on the project).

### Code regulamentation
Code is contained into RawCMS git repository. This repository will contain all projects related to this product. This will allow to have always a working set of components to be tested\released (core, demo, cli, ui). 

### Code flow
We will use GitFlow as reference for branch usages, and more:

- Nobody is allowed to directly push on shared branches (dev,releases) whithout approval from somebody else. 
- We will use 1 feature branch for each feature. 
- All feature will be merged by a PR. 

### Documentation
Documentation will be produced directly into code repository. This will be done by adding md files into /docs/ directory. This may seems an old way to produce documentation comparing with visual wiki or other tools, but is the way to make it possible to writedown documentation while developing removing friction using multiple tool and switch context ( doc file will be available within IDE).

Docs folder will be available online via readthedoc.
